## Answers
1. ### What is Solidity?
   
Solidity is a high-level language used in the blockchain ecosystem for implementing smart contracts. Designed specifically for targeting the Ethereum Virtual Machine, Solidity was influenced by several <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/best-programming-languages-start-learning-today-article" target="black">programming languages</a>, such as JavaScript, Python, and C++.

3. ### What types of applications can be developed using Solidity?
   
Solidity finds its application in creating smart contracts on Ethereum, which is a decentralized platform that is responsible for running smart contracts. Smart contracts function just as programmed and they are not prone to third-party interference. While it is most commonly used for developing smart contracts, you can also develop complex decentralized applications. You can develop various aspects, such as voting systems, crowdfunding platforms, decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and much more.
