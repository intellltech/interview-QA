## Answers
1. ### Tell me about yourself?
   
I’m excited to introduce myself. My name is Steven Bakarich, and I’m a blockchain expert with over 10 years of experience in designing and developing decentralized applications, smart contracts, and blockchain integrations. I specialize in Ethereum, Solidity, Hyperledger, and Layer-2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum.

Currently, I’m a Senior Blockchain Developer at Zapper, where I lead the design and auditing of smart contracts, integrate DeFi protocols, and enhance cross-chain capabilities. Before that, I worked at ShareRing, where I built custom blockchain solutions using the Cosmos SDK and developed secure decentralized identity systems. My journey started at BitQuick, where I built a cryptocurrency exchange from the ground up, combining full-stack development with blockchain integration.

I enjoy building scalable and secure blockchain ecosystems and mentoring teams to deliver innovative solutions. I’m passionate about staying at the forefront of blockchain advancements and creating systems that are both impactful and accessible.
