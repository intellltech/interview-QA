63. ### What do CTIDs mean in PostgreSQL?

CTIDs is a column that exists in every PostgreSQL database and is used to identify individual physical rows inside a table based on their block and offset positions. Index entries utilize them to point to actual rows. It is distinct for each entry in the table and clearly identifies the tuple's position. Because the CTID of a logical row changes when it is changed, it cannot be utilized as a long-term row identifier. When no competing update is expected, it is occasionally advantageous to identify a row within a transaction.

64. ### Explain tokens in PostgreSQL.

Tokens are the fundamental components of any source code. Many of the special character symbols are known to be found in them. Constants, quoted identifiers, other identifiers, and keywords are examples of these. Tokens, or keywords, are pre-defined SQL instructions with pre-defined meanings. Variable names, such as columns and tables, are represented by identifiers.

65. ### How do you delete data from a table in PostgreSQL?

To delete data from a table in PostgreSQL, you can use the DELETE FROM statement. Here's an example:

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

Replace table_name with the name of the table you want to delete data from. The WHERE clause is optional but recommended to specify the condition for deletion. If no condition is provided, all rows in the table will be deleted. Be cautious when using DELETE FROM without a condition.
